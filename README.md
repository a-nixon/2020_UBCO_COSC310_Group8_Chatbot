## Chatbot Features:  
* **Database files**  
Stores all chat dialogue in a database file. Easily change dialogue by specifying a different database.
* **Database Manager** (AKA Respose Manager)  
A GUI interface for editing chatbot respose databases.
* **Networking**  
Chatbot can act as a server, client or remote terminal for interacting with other chatbots. 
Terminal mode does not generate any conversation, it allows users to connect to and interact
with a remote chatbot (or any sockts server).
